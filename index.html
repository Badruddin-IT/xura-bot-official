      <h2>Developer</h2>
      <p>Xura Bot was created to simplify Discord server management and enhance community engagement. Our goal was to unify multiple features—like moderation, economy, fun games, music, and utility tools—into a single powerful bot that’s easy to use for everyone. It eliminates the need for multiple bots and helps create a dynamic, automated server environment. We’re dedicated to making Xura Bot efficient, stylish, and constantly evolving to meet user needs.</p>
